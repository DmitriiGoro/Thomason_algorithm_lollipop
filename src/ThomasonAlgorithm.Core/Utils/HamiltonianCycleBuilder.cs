    /// The cycle visits all vertices from 0 to <paramref name="n"/> - 1 in sequential order, 
    /// with each vertex connected to its adjacent vertices in the cycle. 
    /// The cycle is represented as an undirected graph where each vertex is connected to its
    /// predecessor and successor in the cycle.

    /// A dictionary where the key is a vertex index (0 to <paramref name="n"/> - 1), 
    /// and the value is a list of neighboring vertices in the Hamiltonian cycle. 
    /// Each vertex will have exactly two neighbors, one before and one after it in the cycle.
    /// </returns>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This method generates a simple Hamiltonian cycle where each vertex is connected
    /// to the next one in sequence, with the first and last vertices connected to form a loop.
    /// The result is useful for constructing cubic graphs where the Hamiltonian cycle is needed
    /// for further graph manipulations or as a base for other algorithms.
