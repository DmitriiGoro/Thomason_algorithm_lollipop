            <summary>
            Provides a static implementation of Thomason's Lollipop Algorithm for transforming
            an existing Hamiltonian cycle in a cubic graph into a second distinct Hamiltonian cycle.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The algorithm requires a valid Hamiltonian cycle to be provided as input. It modifies a copy of the
            input cycle without altering the original, allowing non-destructive exploration of Hamiltonian paths.
            <para>
            It is assumed that the input Hamiltonian cycle starts at vertex 0.
            The first edge removed during the algorithm's execution is (0, n-1).

            <remarks>
            This method maintains a collection of chord lengths, where each chord length is mapped to its frequency (how many times it has been added).
            It also keeps track of the maximum chord length encountered during the process.

            <summary>
            Represents a cubic graph with an associated Hamiltonian cycle. 
            Provides functionality to initialize the graph with or without a provided cycle.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This class ensures that a Hamiltonian cycle is explicitly associated with a specific cubic graph,
            providing better consistency and clarity when passing this data between methods or components.

            <para>
            This method generates a basic Hamiltonian cycle that connects all vertices in the graph 
            in a simple sequential pattern: 0 → 1 → 2 → ... → n-1 → 0.

            <para>
            The resulting cycle has these properties:
